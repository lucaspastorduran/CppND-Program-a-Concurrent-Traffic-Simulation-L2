# CPPND: Program a Concurrent Traffic Simulation Part 2: Promises, Futures and async

<img src="data/traffic_simulation.gif"/>

This is the project for the fourth course in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213): Concurrency. 

Throughout the Concurrency course, you have been developing a traffic simulation in which vehicles are moving along streets and are crossing intersections. However, with increasing traffic in the city, traffic lights are needed for road safety. Each intersection will therefore be equipped with a traffic light. In this project, you will build a suitable and thread-safe communication protocol between vehicles and intersections to complete the simulation. Use your knowledge of concurrent programming (such as mutexes, locks and message queues) to implement the traffic lights and integrate them properly in the code base.

## Dependencies for Running Locally
* cmake >= 2.8
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* OpenCV >= 4.1
  * The OpenCV 4.1.0 source code can be found [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/4.1.0)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory in the top level directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./traffic_simulation`.

## Project Tasks

When the project is built initially, all traffic lights will be green. When you are finished with the project, your traffic simulation should run with red lights controlling traffic, just as in the .gif file above. See the classroom instruction and code comments for more details on each of these parts. 

- **Task L2.1** : In method Vehicle::drive(), start up a task using std::async which takes a reference to the method Intersection::addVehicleToQueue, the object _currDestination and a shared pointer to this using the get_shared_this() function. Then, wait for the data to be available before proceeding to slow down.

- **Task L2.2** : In method Intersection::addVehicleToQueue(), add the new vehicle to the waiting line by creating a promise, a corresponding future and then adding both to _waitingVehicles. Then wait until the vehicle has been granted entry.

- **Task L2.3** : In method WaitingVehicles::permitEntryToFirstInQueue(), get the entries from the front of _promises and _vehicles. Then, fulfill promise and send signal back that permission to enter has been granted. Finally, remove the front elements from both queues.
